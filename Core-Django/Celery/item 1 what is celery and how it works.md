## Celery 
```text
Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to 
process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations
with the tools required to maintain such a system.

It's a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also 
supporting task scheduling.

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across 
threads or machines.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers,
giving way to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Celery allows you to execute background tasks asynchronously,
which is especially useful for long-running or time-consuming
operations that shouldn't block the main application.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be 
implemented in any language.
Celery can run on single machine, on multiple machines, or 
even across data center.
