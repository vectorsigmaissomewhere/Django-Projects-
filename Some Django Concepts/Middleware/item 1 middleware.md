## Middleware
```text
Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django's request/response
processing.
It's a light, low-level "plugin" system for globally altering Django's input
or output. Each middleware component is responsible for doing some
specific function.

- Built in Middleware , this is already present and we are using it
- Custom Middleware
```

How Middleware Works
```text
Middleware means something in between 
user sent a request middleware checks if it is valid or not 
if valid the request is sent to the required views 


There can be more than one middleware 
```
